# IaC-AWS-DevEnv

#### AWS Hosted Dev Env

This terraform project allows users to automate the provisioning and configuration of a developer environment hosted on AWS. This project will be updated to include a private subnet, bastion host, Load Balancer, and an Autoscaling Group.

#### Sources

This project was based off of a freeCodeCamp.org project!

I also relied heavily on the documentation on the Terraform Website
- https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs

#### Project Key Languages/Technologies: 

- **AWS**
    - Resources: 
        - Networking: VPC, subnets, internet gateways, route tables
        - Security: Security groups, key-pairs
        - Compute: EC2
- **Terraform**
- **bash**


## Design Choices:

#### Architecture:
- ![AWSArch](images/AWSArch.png)

#### IaC Tools:
- **CloudFormation vs Terraform vs Ansible**: I decided to use Terraform instead of CloudFormation or Ansible because I wanted to use a tool that was capable of managing complex states of multi-cloud infrastructure.

#### Cloud Provider:
- **AWS vs Azure vs GCP**: Since I received my AWS Associate Certification and worked most extensively with AWS, I decided to build out this project on AWS instead of Azure or GCP.

#### Terraform Tips
- **Terraform**: Terraform has many native features that make it easy to track states
    - terraform.tfstate: this file is automatically generated by terraform and lists all existing resources and their configurations
    - Functions
        - file(path)
        - templatefile(path, var)
        var lets us pass variables into the file in path
    - CLI Commands
        - terraform state 
            - shows all resources and a quick overview of whatâ€™s being managed
            - show resource_name: this will show you the resource and the current configuration of that resource
                - example: terraform state show aws_instance.dev_node
        - terraform show
            - Used when you need detailed information about specific resources or the entire infrastructure.
        - terraform fmt
            - formats the code to look nicer
        - terraform plan
            - tells you what resources will be created and destroyed when you run the new template
        - terraform apply 
            - auto-approve 
                - applies the template to your aws resources without needed type in yes, do this when you already used plan
            - replace resource
                - terraform apply -replace aws_instance.dev_node
                    - will update/replace the resource
            - refresh-only
                - tells Terraform to refresh the state and exit without making any changes to the infrastructure itself, even if there are differences between the state and the actual resources.
        - terraform destroy -auto-approve
            -  destroys all resources
        - terraform output
            - displays the outputs in outputs.tf
        - terraform console
            - allows you play around with things without changing the infrastrucuture
            - "exit" to get out of it

#### Linux & Bash Tips
- **SSH**
    - ssh-keygen -t ed25519
        - generates a better keypair gen than rsa, this will be saved and used for ssh authentication
    - ssh -i  ~/.ssh/basic_key ubuntu@EC2InstancePublicIP
        - this will allow you to SSH into the EC2
        - make sure the SG ingress CIDR includes your IP
    - cat ~/.ssh/config
        - displays the contents of the SSH (Secure Shell) configuration file located at ~/.ssh/config.
        - cat is used to output the contents of a file.

## Folders/Files:

- **main.tf**: Most of the AWS infrastructure resources are defined here

- **providers.tf**: Because Terraform can support different cloud platforms, this file is used to define and configure the cloud platforms that I will be using (AWS).

- **userdata.tpl**: Stores a bash script that is used to configure the EC2 instance on boot. The script installs docker and adds the ubuntu user to the docker group.

- **linux-ssh-config.tpl**: Stores a bash scrip that is used to configure the SSH access to the dev node.

- **datasource.tf**: Stores the ubuntu server AMI that we will use in this project. Allows us to avoid hardcoding the AMI into main.tf

- **outputs.tf**: This file is recognized by Terraform and allows you to access specific values after applying a configuration. In this case, it allows us to easily access the public IP address of the dev node with a "terraform output" command.

- **terraform.tfvars**: This file is recogized by Terraform and takes highest precedence when setting values to variables in .tf files. In this case, it is used to set the OS of the provisioner's interperter to linux.

- **.gitignore**: Contains files and folders that were not to be included in the GitHub Repository.
